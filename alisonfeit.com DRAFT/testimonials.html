											<h3>Testimonials</h3>
										</header>
										
										<p>"With a certain special brand of psychological-mindedness, she facilitates our ability to face our own self-doubts. She challenges the anxieties that challenge the opportunity to live full and connected lives. In an age of what feels like almost unprecedented loss and fear she gives us the capacity to look inside and face the most difficult part of our internal lives. In these sensitive and difficult situations, implementing Alison’s way of thinking allows for real and substantive change in life and work."<br> – Robin Mitchell, MA, Community Coordinator at NYC Administration for Children's Services​</p>
										<p>"Alison is a voice that can really make a difference. Instead of quick fix advice, she offers a new lens, so we can take a look at our own strengths, and the tricks our mind plays on us. In that way, we see the answers are within ourselves, and we can build a toolbox for the next time life throws a curve ball. Not only is she a psychoanalyst – the most complete psychotherapeutic training that exists – but she is trained and steeped in the interpersonal-relational school. Both that training and her personality allow her to sense what a person is seeking, what they are missing as well as their strengths, and what brings them to the moment they find themselves in currently. Dr. Feit meets the callers and readers where they are, but also meets our culture with a factor that is currently missing."<br> – A. Chris Heath, MD, Creator of the HeathMD YouTube Channel</p>
										<p>"Alison Feit is an extraordinary psychoanalyst. She has a talent for understanding a situation and helpfully suggesting a new way to look at an old problem. She has an agile mind, a warm approach, and a keen intelligence."<br> – Richard B. Gartner, PhD, Author of <em>Betrayed as Boys: Psychodynamic Treatment of Sexually Abused Men</em>; Co-Founder of MaleSurvivor</p>
										<p>"I have known Dr. Alison Feit for over 25 years. She is a thoughtful, humane scholar and therapist who has been willing to tread where others have not and is rarely afraid to speak her mind. I have known her to go out of her way for people who were ignored by others and to devote herself to the welfare of people you might think had no claim on her. She is irreverent in all the right ways."<br> – Don Seeman, PhD, Associate Professor, Emory University</p>
										<p>"Alison Feit, PhD is a highly skilled psychoanalyst and a class act. She is a valued colleague and friend. Her wisdom, skills and warmth are recognized by many, both in and outside of psychoanalysis. She is engaging and welcoming with a non-judgmental style that makes it easy to share personal concerns. Dr. Feit has been an advocate on behalf of others; successfully taking on issues and problems that were previously swept under the rug or ignored. I admire her breadth, depth, creativity and her willingness to pursue new ventures."<br> – Lucille Spira, PhD, Psychotherapist, Editor of <em>Rage and Creativity: How Feminism Sparked Psychoanalysis</em></p>
										<p>"I know Alison Feit very well and have become a huge fan of her no-holds-barred, no-nonsense passion for understanding what is getting in the way of growth and how to flip that script. She goes for the heart, headfirst with humor, creativity, compassion and rigor that make her an unusual treasure in the field of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy."<br> – Juliet Heeg, LCSW-R, Relationship Therapist and Author</p>
										<p>"I have known Alison Feit for many years and know many people who have relied on her for both professional and personal advice. She is a thoughtful listener, open minded and insightful. Over the years, she has shown people how to look at themselves in ways that helped create meaning in their lives. Her approach is not a “method” or textbook formula. She allows people to arrive at their own understanding by providing navigational tools to create the future they desire. Because she sees people as individuals, she helps them create their own roadmaps."<br> – Jack Drescher, MD, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University</p>
										<p>"Alison is one of those people who knows a lot and is exceptionally with-it. She radiates joy from enabling others to develop their inner capacity to grow and to flourish. She is the generator and a world-class expert on BIRS (Basking In Reflected Sunshine). She takes it seriously. What that means for you is that in real-time, she is at her happiest and most creative when others around her are thriving. She has given me the tools to feel positive and optimistic on my darkest days. A feedback loop of positivity and growth with those around you! Something I am delighted to share with my children and students."<br> – Alberta Guiles, MBA, Chemical Engineer, Yale University</p>
